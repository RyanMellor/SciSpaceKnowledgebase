NMR spectroscopy exploits the absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation by nuclei to determine physical and chemical properties of individual atoms within a molecule, from which the structure of the entire molecule may be inferred. This process is only applicable to nuclei which have a non-zero spin, i.e. contain an odd number of protons and/or neutron, for this reason the isotopes most commonly analysed by NMR are $$^{1}H$$ and $$^{13}C$$.

## Experiments

### Proton

$$^{1}H$$ NMR output provides three dimensions of information for each proton – chemical shift, peak area, and coupling, from which we can infer electronic environment, number of protons, and neighbours respectively. Chemical shift is the amount of energy required to flip a spin relative to tetramethylsilane, this is determined by the electron shielding of the proton, and can be used to determine the functional group to which the proton belongs by comparison to reference charts. The peak area of a particular electronic environment is proportional to the number of protons occupying such an environment. Coupling occurs when a proton has a number (N) of neighbours with non-zero spin, this will appear as N+1 peaks centred around where the peak would appear if N = 0, plus and minus the magnetic contribution of the neighbour(s).

### Carbon

$$^{13}C$$ NMR provides essentially the equivalent quanta with the exception that coupling is not observed, this is because $$^{13}C-^{1}H$$ spin-spin interactions are filtered out, and only \~1% of carbon atoms are of the $$^{13}C$$ isotope making the chances of $$^{13}C-^{13}C$$ neighbouring negligible.

### Correlation Spectroscopy

COSY is a form of 2D NMR in that it plots a 1D NMR spectrum against itself to identify interacting homonuclei, usually protons. The diagonal of the plot, where both spectra show the same value, essentially shows the 1D NMR of the sample. However, the cross-peaks (those which do not lie on the diagonal) correspond to a pair of interacting homonuclei separated by no more than 4 bonds.

### Heteronuclear Multiple-Quantum Correlation

HMQC identifies correlation of a proton and heteronucleus separated by a single bond, most commonly $$^{1}H-^{13}C$$. This is valuable for identifying the chemical shift value of a specific carbon atom in a structure from that of a known proton, and vice versa.

### Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer

DEPT-135 is a polarization transfer method between protons and a bound nucleus most commonly $$^{13}C$$. It applies a pulse delay of 3π/4 (135°) to differentiate between degrees of protonation, i.e. between methyl ($$CH_3$$) or methine ($$CH$$), and methylene ($$CH_2$$) groups, represented as opposite phases. DEPT-45 and DEPT-90 variations exist which show CH groups only and all protonation levels in the same phase respectively, $$CH_4$$ groups are omitted by all DEPT methods.
