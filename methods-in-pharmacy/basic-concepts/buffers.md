# Buffers

A buffer is an aqueous solution that resists changes in pH, the solution comprises a mixture of **weak acid** ($$HA$$) and its **conjugate base** ($$A^-$$) in equilibrium.&#x20;

$$pH=pKa+log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right)$$

Therefore, when $$[HA]=[A^-]$$it is true that $$pH=pKa$$regardless of total concentration.

For $$pH$$to change by 1,$$\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$$must change by a factor of 10, the amount of acid/base required to do this is the **bufferering capacity** ($$\beta$$).

$$\beta=\frac{moles\ of H^+ or\ OH^- added}{pH\ change\ *\ volume\ of\ buffer\ in\ L}$$
