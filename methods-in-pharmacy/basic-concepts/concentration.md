# Concentration

## Definitions

Concentration describes the amount of a particular component relative to the total mixture. This is most commonly the amount of solute in a volume of solvent.

Qualitatively, a mixture goes from **dilute** to **concentrated** to **saturated** as the amount of substance increases up to the point where no more solute can be dissolved. In formulations, we require much stricter, quantitative definitions.

### Mass Concentration (m/V)

The mass of a constituent (m) divided the volume of a mixture (V)

SI unit **kg/m³**, common units **g/L** or **mg/mL**

### **Mass fraction (parts-per)**

The mass of a constituent (m) divided the mass of a mixture (m\_tot)

Commonly used for dilute aqueous solutions where the density of water is 1kg/L, i.e. 1 ppm = 1 mg/mL = 1 mg/g

SI unit **kg/kg**, common units parts-per -million (ppm), -billion (ppb)

### Molar Concentration (M)

The moles of a constituent (n) divided the volume of a mixture (V)

SI unit **mol/m³**, common unit **mol/L**

### Mola**l** Concentration (m)

The moles of a constituent (n) divided the mass of a mixture (m\_tot)

SI unit **mol/m³**, common unit **mol/L**

### **Percentage (%)**

The weight (w) or volume (v) of a constituent divided the weight (w) or volume (v) of a mixture, expressed as a percentage.

Common units **w/w**, **w/v**, **v/v**

### Mole fraction (χ)

The moles of a constituent (n) divided the moles of a mixture (n\_tot)

SI unit **mol/mol**, common units parts-per -million (ppm), -billion (ppb)

### Beer-Lambert law

$$A = log_{10}(\frac{I_{0}}{I}) = \varepsilon lc$$

Where:

* $$A$$= Absorbance
* $$I_{0}$$= incident intensity
* $$I$$ = transmitted intensity
* $$\varepsilon$$ = molar extinction coefficient
* $$l$$ = length of light path
* $$c$$ = concentration

## Methods of Determination

### Spectrophotometric

A known amount of the compound is dissolved in a solvent, and it’s UV-Vis spectrum is recorded. This allows selection of an appropriate wavelength. Once the wavelength is chosen, a minimum of 5 standards at equally-spaced concentrations are prepared.

The choice of concentration is based on the absorbance value obtained during the first measurement. Usually, absorbance values should be between $$0.2 < A < 1.2$$ to ensure reliable response from the instrument.

The concentrations of standard solutions (x-axis) are plotted against response (y-axis) to provide a [calibration curve](calibration.md#calibration-curve).
