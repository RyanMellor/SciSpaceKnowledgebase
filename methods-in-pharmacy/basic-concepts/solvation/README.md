# Solubility and Solvation

**Solubility** is the property of one chemical substance (solid, liquid, or gas) - the **solute** - to dissolve in another chemical substance - the **solvent**. Solubility is reported as the [concentration ](../concentration.md)of solute at **saturation**. **Solvation** describes the interaction of the two substances.

### Solubility Qualifiers

Solubility ranges from **miscible** (very soluble, solvent dissolves unlimited amounts of solute**)** to **immiscible** (insoluble, solvent does not dissolve solute). The following descriptive terms apply to solubility values between miscible and immiscible :

## Solubility Factors

### Temperature

#### van 't Hoff equation (under standard conditions)

$$\frac{d}{dT} ln K_{eq} = \frac{ΔH}{RT^2}$$

Where:

* $$K_{eq}$$= Thermodynamic equilibrium constant
* $$ΔH$$= Standard enthalpy change of reaction
* $$R$$= Gas constant = 8.314 JK$$^{-1}$$mol$$^{-1}$$
* $$T$$= Temperature (K)

This states that if the reaction (dissolution) is **endothermic** ($$ΔH > 0$$) then increasing temperature will increase solubility, the opposite is true if the reaction is **exothermic** ($$ΔH < 0$$).

### Pressure

The dependence of solubility on pressure is small and usually neglected in practical applications.

### Polarity

Polarity is a separation of electric charge across a chemical bond  due to a difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms, referred to as a **dipole moment**. Water has a high dipole moment, therefore substances which are soluble in water are termed **polar**, **hydrophilic** (water-loving), and **lipophobic** (lipid-hating). Conversely, substances which are insoluble in water are termed **non-polar**, **hydrophobic** (water-hating), and **lipophilic** (lipid-loving). This relationship is often simplified to "**like-dissolves-like**", a good rule of thumb for predicting miscibility of two substances.
