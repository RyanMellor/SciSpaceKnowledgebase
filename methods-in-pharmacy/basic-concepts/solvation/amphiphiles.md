# Amphiphiles

**Amphiphiles** are molecules that contain both polar and non-polar groups. **Surfactants** are amphiphiles that self-assembly into [micelles](../../pre-formulation-and-formulation/nano-systems.md#micelles)/[liposomes](../../pre-formulation-and-formulation/nano-systems.md#liposome), **hydrotropes** are those that do not but are still able to form [emulsions](../../pre-formulation-and-formulation/nano-systems.md#nano-emulsions).

### Methods of Determination

**Pyrene Fluorescence**

Pyrene exhibits a characteristic fluorescence spectrum between 360 and 400 nm following excitation at 340 nm. This region is comprised of 5 distinct vibrionic bands (I1-I5), and it is known that the I1/I3 peak ratio is highly dependent on the hydrophobicity of pyrenes solvent environment, this ratio can therefore be used to determine the CMC of a surfactant. At concentrations below the CMC, the bulk of pyrene will be in a polar environment and the ratio will be high; above the CMC, pyrene will become encapsulated in the hydrophobic cores of micelles and the ratio will decrease rapidly.
