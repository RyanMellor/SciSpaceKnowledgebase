# Clinical Trials

## Phases

### Phase I

Studies in healthy volunteers to assess tolerability, metabolism, SARS, and mechanism of action in humans

* 50–200 healthy subjects (usually) or patients who are not expected to benefit from the IMP
* Investigation
  * Is the IMP safe in humans?
  * What does the body do to the IMP? (pharmacokinetics)
  * What does the IMP do to the body? (pharmacodynamics)
  * Will the IMP work in patients?

### Phase II

Studies in patients with the target disease to assess efficacy, short-term side effects, and risks

* 100–400 patients with the target disease
* Investigation
  * Is the IMP safe in patients?
  * Does the IMP seem to work in patients?

### Phase III

Confirmation of phase II findings in a broad base of patients

* 1000–5000 patients with the target disease
* Investigation
  * Is the IMP really safe in patients?
  * Does the IMP really work in patients?

### Phase IV

Post-marketing surveillance. Conducted to obtain additional data on safety and efficacy over the life of the drug

* Many thousands or millions of patients with the target disease
* Investigation
  * Just how safe is the new medicine? (pharmacovigilance)
  * How does the new medicine compare with similar medicines?
