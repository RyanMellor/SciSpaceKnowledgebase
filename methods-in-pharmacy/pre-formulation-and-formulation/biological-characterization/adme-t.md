# ADME(T)

## Absorption

Oral delivery is the most desirable route of administration, to achieve this the drug must be absorbed through intestinal epithelium (mucosa)

**Absorption mechanisms**

* **Passive diffusion:** Driven by concentration gradient which occurs either between cell junctions (paracellular transport) or through the cytoplasm (transcellular transport)
* **Active transport:** Transporter proteins actively transport specific substances. This process requires energy and mostly affect vital substances such as glucose and amino acids
  * P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a specific transporter also called an efflux pump as it transports substances from the cytoplasm back to the intestinal lumen. P-gp affects absorption as it can “eject” part of a permeated drug out of the cytoplasm back into the intestinal lumen. Inhibitors of P-gp have been identified and could increase intestinal absorptions of P-gp substrates ([Li, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#li-a-p-2001-screening-for-human-adme-tox-drug-properties-in-drug-discovery-drug-discovery-today-6-357-366-https-doi-org-10-1016-s-1359-6446-01-01712-3)).

Lipophilic compounds pass the plasma membrane with relative ease, thus are mainly transported via the transcellular route. However, hydrophilic compounds are relatively impermeable across the cell membrane and will be primarily transported via the paracellular route ([Li, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#li-a-p-2001-screening-for-human-adme-tox-drug-properties-in-drug-discovery-drug-discovery-today-6-357-366-https-doi-org-10-1016-s-1359-6446-01-01712-3)). Nevertheless, as different pathways of drug permeation exist it is difficult to accurately estimate permeability of a drug simply from its physicochemical properties (eg. pKa, LogP/logD, solubility).

## Distribution



## Metabolism

After oral absorption the drug enters the hepatic portal circulation which will lead to the liver. In the liver drugs are subjected to metallization. Metabolism is a form of elimination of the drug as active drugs may be inactivated by introducing changes in its structure ([Park, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#park-g-2001-drug-metabolism-bja-cepd-reviews-1-185-188-https-doi-org-10-1093-bjacepd-1-6-185)). Metabolism often makes the drug more hydrophilic which makes permeation across cells more difficult but facilitates elimination via the bile and kidneys ([Park, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#park-g-2001-drug-metabolism-bja-cepd-reviews-1-185-188-https-doi-org-10-1093-bjacepd-1-6-185)). Here we look at hepatic metabolism, but drug-transforming enzymes can be found in other parts of the body. Metabolic pathways are grouped in 2 groups: phase I & phase II.

**Phase I**

The first step in a drugs metabolism is a functionalization reaction creating a reactive functional group on the molecule allowing further modification during phase II metabolism. Different chemical reactions are possible during phase I such as oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, hydration, dethioacetylation and isomerization of the parent group ([Gibson and Skett, 2013](../../../sources/references.md#gibson-g-g-skett-p-2013-introduction-to-drug-metabolism-springer)). The most common pathway is oxidation mediated by a group of enzymes called CYPs (predominantly: CUP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP29C, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E and CYP3A4) ([Li, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#li-a-p-2001-screening-for-human-adme-tox-drug-properties-in-drug-discovery-drug-discovery-today-6-357-366-https-doi-org-10-1016-s-1359-6446-01-01712-3)). Other enzymes implicated in phase I metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, alkylhydrazine oxidase, amine oxidase, aromatases and xanthine oxidase ([Park, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#park-g-2001-drug-metabolism-bja-cepd-reviews-1-185-188-https-doi-org-10-1093-bjacepd-1-6-185)). The product of phase I metabolism is an intermediate metabolite which may be highly reactive and in some cases even toxic ([Park, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#park-g-2001-drug-metabolism-bja-cepd-reviews-1-185-188-https-doi-org-10-1093-bjacepd-1-6-185)).

**Phase II**

In a second step conjugation of a highly polar moiety to the functionalized moiety takes place. Different moieties can be conjugated such as glucose (glucuronidation), sulphate (sulfation), methionine/cysteine (amino acid conjugation), glutathione (gluthathion conjugation), methyl (methylation), acetyl (acetylation), and fatty acids. Phase II enzymes are usually present in much larger concentrations than phase I enzymes ([Park, 2001](../../../sources/references.md#park-g-2001-drug-metabolism-bja-cepd-reviews-1-185-188-https-doi-org-10-1093-bjacepd-1-6-185)).

In general, a drug may not have one defined metabolic pathway but can be metabolized by a variety of enzymes resulting in different metabolites. Some resulting metabolites may still be active, moreover some drugs (called prodrugs) require metallization to become active.

**Effect of metabolism on drug delivery**

* The metabolism of a drug is an important parameter in ADME and affects different aspects of drug delivery.
* **Metabolic stability:** This affects the dosing scheme of a drug. For a drug which is rapidly metabolized the window where the drug has an adequate therapeutic plasma level is short and thus requires frequent administration.
* **Interactions:** If two or more drugs are administered at the same time, interactions can occur. Interaction is possible in different ways such as competition for an enzyme (this predominantly affect phase I metabolism). Moreover, some drugs are inhibitor or inducer of enzymes which means they slow down or accelerate the enzymes activity and thus increase drug concentration (toxicity) or decrease it (no therapeutic effect) respectively. This is an example of a pharmacokinetic interaction.
* **Drug toxicity:** Some metabolic pathways result in a toxic compound.
