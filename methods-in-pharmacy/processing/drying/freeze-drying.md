# Freeze Drying

Freeze drying, or lyophilization, is the process of cooling a sample below the solvents triple point temperature ($$0.01\degree C$$ for water) and reducing the pressure below the triple point pressure ($$6.12\ mbar$$ for water). In this configuration, liquid phase cannot exist and solid transitions directly to gas by the process of sublimation.

### Procedure

#### Pretreatment

Pretreatment involves the addition of excipients to improve the product or drying process:

* **Antimicrobial agents:** Prevent microbial growth in the cake
  * Benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben
* **Bulking agents:** Add bulk to low concentration APIs
  * Sugars, amino acids, dextran, and PEG
* **Buffers:** Control pH during freeze drying and after reconstitution
  * See [buffers](../../basic-concepts/buffers.md)
* **Collapse inhibitors:** Increase collapse temperature ($$T_C$$) of formulation to get higher drying temperatures
  * Dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, ficoll, gelatin, and mono/di/oligosaccharides
* **Lyoprotectants:** Protect the API during freeze drying
  * Dextran, and mono/disaccharides
* **Solubilizing agents:** Increase solubility of API in formulation
  * Complexing agents, surfactants, and co-solvents
* **Structure modifiers:** Enhance mechanical properties of cake
  * Disaccharides, mannitol, and glycine
* **Tonicity adjusters:** Yield an isotonic formulation after reconstitution
  * Salts, glycerol, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose

#### Freezing

Sample is cooled below the solvents triple point temperature. Slow cooling favours formation of large ice crystals, which maximizes ice connectivity and rate of sublimation.

#### Primary drying

Removes frozen water. Carried out at reduced temperature and pressure.

#### Secondary drying

Removes bound water. Carried out at elevated temperature and reduced pressure.
