# Centrifugation

**Stokes' Law equation**

$$v=\frac{d^2(p-L)g}{18n}$$

Where:

* $$v$$ = Sedimentation rate ($$m/s$$)
* $$d$$ = Diameter of sphere (assumed shape of particle) ($$m$$)
* $$p$$ = Particle density ($$kg/m^3$$)
* $$L$$ = Medium density ($$kg/m^3$$)
* $$n$$ = Medium dynamic viscosity ($$kg/(m\ s)$$)
* $$g$$ = Gravitational field strength ($$m/s^2$$)

Observations from Stokes' law:

* $$v$$ is proportional to particle size
* $$v$$ is proportional to difference in density between particle and medium
* $$v$$ is zero when particle density equals medium density
* $$v$$ is proportional to gravitational field strength
* $$v$$ is inversely proportional to medium viscosity

**Unit conversion**

$$RCF = 1.118r\left(\frac{RPM}{1000}\right)^2$$

$$RPM=1000\sqrt{\frac{RCF}{1.118r}}$$

Where:

* $$RCF$$ = Relative centrifugal force
* $$RPM$$ = Revolutions per minute
* $$r$$ = Radius of rotation ($$mm$$)

RCF provides a value relative to the force of gravity on earth. The value allows for transfer of methods between centrifuges with different radii.
