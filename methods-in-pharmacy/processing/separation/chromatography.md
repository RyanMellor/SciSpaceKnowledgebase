# Chromatography

See [Chromatography](../../analysis/chromatography/)

Chromatography for the purpose of purification (as opposed to analysis) is termed semi-prep, preparative, pilot, or process, depending on the scale. The same principles apply with a few notable differences:

* Sample volumes are higher
* Flow rates are higher
* Columns used are wider ($$10-300\ mm$$) and longer ($$250-1000\ mm$$)
* Particle sizes are larger ($$>7 \mu m$$)
* A distribution plate ensures even analyte distribution across the column
* After detection, the compound of interest is diverted to a fraction collector
* Mobile phase may be recovered and recycled
