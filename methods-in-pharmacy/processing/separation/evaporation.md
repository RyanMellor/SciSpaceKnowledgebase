# Evaporation

Evaporation separates dissolved components from a solvent. The mixture is heated causing the solvent to evaporate, and leaving the solid components (or higher boiling point solvents) in the original vessel.

### Distillation

Distillation separates components of a mixture based on their differential boiling points. The mixture is heated causing the lowest boiling point component to evaporate, this is condensed back and isolated (the distillate), leaving the higher boiling components in the original vessel.

### Vacuum Distillation

A form of distillation accelerated by applying a vacuum on the system, thereby lowering the boiling point of solvents allowing distillation at lower temperatures.

### Solvent Evaporation Data

$$T_p = \frac{T_{bp}}{(3.006-log\ p)b+1}$$

Where:

* $$T_p$$ = Boiling point (K)
* $$T_{bp}$$ = Boil point under standard conditions (K)
* $$p$$ = Pressure (mbar)
* $$b$$ = Solvent constant, see table below
